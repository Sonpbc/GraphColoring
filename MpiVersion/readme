To compile and build executables do

make

Code for problem 2 is in graphcoloring.c

Run it with

mpirun -np xyz ./graphcoloring input_filename output_filename

where the input_filename is one of the given files representing a graph and
the output_filename contains the color assigned by Jones-Plassmann to each
vertex as well as the largest color assigned.

Notice that some of the files are in a binary format. I used the translation code
provided by cmu to translate those to the normal format.

For example DSJC1000.9.col.b was converted to DSJC1000.9.col and similarly
flat1000.76.col.b was converted to flat1000.76.col.

The input_filename is just the filename and is relative to my directory containing 
all these graph files. Change INPUT_PATH at the top of graphcoloring.c to point to
a different location. Similarly the OUTPUT_PATH constant at the top point to a
location somewhere in my account but it can be changed.

Jobs to compute strong scaling are in files called gcgraphfilenp.pbs. 
For example gcle450_5a8.pbs (8 cores). Jobs to compute weak scaling are in 
files called gcle450_5aorborcversusqueensnp.pbs.

One note about debugging: At the top of each of the .c files there are a 
series of directives that start with DEBUG_XYZ. If defined to be 1 they will
allow for debugging throughout the code. I set them to 0 after testing.
